<!-- This page shows how to create a simple configuration interface using the
     ZHTML features.  Note that each variable has its current value displayed
     and also allows the values to be updated.  When the user submits the form,
     if there are errors in that submission, then this form is redisplyed.
     However, when it is redisplayed, it will inform the user that there were
     errors, and the variables that are in error will be marked in red. -->
